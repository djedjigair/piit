Title: My Analogy of Analysis vs. Analytics

A few months ago, I realized that I was spending too much money every month but wasn`t sure where it was all going. So, I started tracking all my expenses (groceries, coffee, subscriptions, eating out, shopping, activities...). after a month, I sat down and reviewed everything. I categorized my spending and added up how much I spent in each area. This process of looking back to understand where my money went is what I now recognize as analysis. 

Analysis helped me understand my spending habits. It answered questions like: “Where is my money going?” and “What can I cut back on?” As a result, I canceled a few subscriptions and decided to limit how often I'm eating out and started cooking at home.

Once I had this understanding, I moved into analytics. I used the budgeting app to forecast my spending for the next month and set savings goals. It also gave me alerts if I was approaching my budget limit in a category helping me make real time decisions and optimize my spending. This is analytics using past data to optimize future decisions. 

In short, analysis helped me look at what happened, reviewing past expenses to understand where my money went and what needed to change. Analytics, on the other hand, helped me predict what could happen, guiding me to make smarter decisions with my money based on those insights. Using both helped me take control of my budget: analysis showed me the problem, and analytics helped me fix it.
